# Claude Code Instructions

## Preferences
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Refrain from adding unnecessary comments. Write self documenting code. Only explain patterns that deviate from best practices.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

## MCP Usage
- **context7**: Use for library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask
- **kubernetes**: Use for any k8s cluster operations, troubleshooting, or resource inspection
- **filesystem**: Use when needing to read/write files outside the current working directory
- **sequential-thinking**: Use for complex architectural decisions, multi-step problem solving, or system design tasks
