# Claude Code Instructions

## Preferences
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Refrain from adding unnecessary comments. Write self documenting code. Only explain patterns that deviate from best practices.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

## MCP
Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
