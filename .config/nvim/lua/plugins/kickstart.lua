	-- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
	-- with the first argument being the link and the following
	-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
	--
	-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
	--

	-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
	-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
	--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
	--
	-- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do

	--
	-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
	-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
	--
	-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
	--  event = 'VimEnter'
	--
	-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
	-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
	--
	-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
	-- after the plugin has been loaded:
	--  config = function() ... end

	-- Highlight todo, notes, etc in comments

	-- The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
	-- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
	-- place them in the correct locations.

	-- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
	--
	--  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
	--  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
	--
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.lint',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.autopairs',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.neo-tree',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.gitsigns', -- adds gitsigns recommend keymaps

	-- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
	--    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
	--
	--  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
	--    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
	-- { import = 'custom.plugins' },
}
